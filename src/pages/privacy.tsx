                We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global
                workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We
                use the personal data available to us to research social,
                economic and workplace trends such as jobs availability and
                skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the
                gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases,
                we work with trusted third parties to perform this research,
                under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We
                publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented
                as aggregated data rather than personal data.
